    "Our collective intuition going into this project was that players with higher experience and hours would be more likely to subscribe to a gaming newsletter. Upon initial skimming of the `players.csv` dataframe, we noticed that the \"Pro\" experience variable did seem to correlate slightly more often with \"TRUE\", but no strong correlations were visible just by looking. We also saw at a glance that almost all players with over 10 hours of playtime were subscribed, but many also had zero hours, weakening that correlation. So, compared to our expectations that there would be a slight correlation of newsletter subscription with high play hours and experience, we found that `...`"
